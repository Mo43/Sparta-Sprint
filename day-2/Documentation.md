# Instructions for AWS app deployment - Challenge 1 

## Starting Off:
    1.  Search for EC2 on the AWS console. There is a resource tab in the EC2 where you have to select key pairs and create a new key pair, with a naming convention that is familiar and easy to find, for example: 
```
se-firstname-key-pair
```
    2.  Once the private key is made it will be automatically downloaded to your computer. Once it is downloaded you have to add it to your .ssh folder in your user directory, for example in gitbash the code will be:
``` 
$cd C:\\Users\\matta\\.ssh
```
